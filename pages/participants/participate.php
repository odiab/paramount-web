        <p>Clinical research participants can volunteer to  participate in a trial or be invited by the research team to consider the  option of getting involved in a research trial. Participants have largely  benefitted from the one-on-one attention. Many choose to participate in order  to gain more information about his/her particular condition. Some studies have  shown that those who choose to participate in a study do better than their  counterparts, despite the treatment arm of the protocol. Still others find that  contributing to the research process gives them a sense of helping others, as  well as future generations. </p>
