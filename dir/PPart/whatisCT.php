    <p>Although there are many definitions, clinical trials are generally considered to be biomedical or health-related research studies in human beings that follow a pre-defined protocol. Interventional studies are those in which the research subjects are assigned by the investigator to a treatment or other intervention, and their outcomes are measured. Observational studies are those in which individuals are observed and their outcomes are measured by the investigators. <br />

    <p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Phases of Studies
    </h3>
    <p>Before a new medication or therapy is approved by the U.S. FDA, it must pass through several phases of study. The very early phases of a study will aim to evaluate the effects of the drug on animals, usually in much higher doses than what would be given to a human. Phase 1 studies determine how a drug metabolizes through a healthy human under a very controlled environment. Phase 2-4 studies help provide additional information on the drug's safety and efficacy in a certain population of subjects. Usually this is when the best dose is determined. Phase 4 generally refers to drugs/medicines/therapies that have already been approved by the FDA but more information is being collected for marketing and sometimes safety purposes.</p>
